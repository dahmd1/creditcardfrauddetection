# Credit card fraud detection
Binary classification on Kaggle dataset
## Developing environment
* Python 3.8
* Matplotlib: 3.3.2
* Pandas: 1.1.3
* Sklearn: 0.23.2
## Dataset
The dataset used is available here : https://www.kaggle.com/shubhamjoshi2130of/abstract-data-set-for-credit-card-fraud-detection/notebooks

## Demo
2 pretrained logistic regression models (baseline_LR_credit_card_fraud_detection.plk, improved_LR_credit_card_fraud_detection.plk) are available download it and run the demo Jupyter Notebook
(Credit_card_fraud_detection_demo_code.ipynb).

## Benchmark

| Model         | Accuracy | Average inference time |
| ------ -------| -------- | ---------------------- |
|  Baseline LR  |   94%    |         0.001 s        |  
|  Improved LR  |  96%     |         0.008 s        |
